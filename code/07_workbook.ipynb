    "# Dask DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "We finished Chapter 1 by building a parallel dataframe computation over a directory of CSV files using `dask.delayed`.  In this section we use `dask.dataframe` to automatically build similiar computations, for the common case of tabular computations.  Dask dataframes look and feel like Pandas dataframes but they run on the same infrastructure that powers `dask.delayed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we use the same airline data as before, but now rather than write for-loops we let `dask.dataframe` construct our computations for us.  The `dask.dataframe.read_csv` function can take a globstring like `\"data/nycflights/*.csv\"` and build parallel computations on all of our data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use `dask.dataframe`\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is great for tabular datasets that fit in memory. Dask becomes useful when the dataset you want to analyze is larger than your machine's RAM. The demo dataset we're working with is only about 200MB, so that you can download it in a reasonable time, but `dask.dataframe` will scale to  datasets much larger than memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dask.dataframe` module implements a blocked parallel `DataFrame` object that mimics a large subset of the Pandas `DataFrame` API. One Dask `DataFrame` is comprised of many in-memory pandas `DataFrames` separated along the index. One operation on a Dask `DataFrame` triggers many pandas operations on the constituent pandas `DataFrame`s in a way that is mindful of potential parallelism and memory constraints.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "len(df[~df.Cancelled])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.) In total, how many non-cancelled flights were taken from each airport?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: use [`df.groupby`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df[~df.Cancelled].groupby('Origin').Origin.count().compute()\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.) What was the average departure delay from each airport?\n",

    "```python\n",
    "df.groupby(\"DayOfWeek\").DepDelay.mean().compute()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing Intermediate Results\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing all of the above, we sometimes did the same operation more than once. For most operations, `dask.dataframe` hashes the arguments, allowing duplicate computations to be shared, and only computed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets compute the mean and standard deviation for departure delay of all non-canceled flights. Since dask operations are lazy, those values aren't the final results yet. They're just the recipe required to get the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compute them with two calls to compute, there is no sharing of intermediate computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "non_cancelled = df[~df.Cancelled]\n",
    "mean_delay = non_cancelled.DepDelay.mean()\n",

    "%%time\n",
    "\n",
    "mean_delay_res, std_delay_res = dask.compute(mean_delay, std_delay)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `dask.compute` takes roughly 1/2 the time. This is because the task graphs for both results are merged when calling `dask.compute`, allowing shared operations to only be done once instead of twice. In particular, using `dask.compute` only does the following once:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the calls to `read_csv`\n",
    "- the filter (`df[~df.Cancelled]`)\n",
    "- some of the necessary reductions (`sum`, `count`)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what the merged task graphs between multiple results look like (and what's shared), you can use the `dask.visualize` function (we might want to use `filename='graph.pdf'` to save the graph to disk so that we can zoom in more easily):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dask.visualize(mean_delay, std_delay)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does this compare to Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is more mature and fully featured than `dask.dataframe`.  If your data fits in memory then you should use Pandas.  The `dask.dataframe` module gives you a limited `pandas` experience when you operate on datasets that don't fit comfortably in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this tutorial we provide a small dataset consisting of a few CSV files.  This dataset is 45MB on disk that expands to about 400MB in memory. This dataset is small enough that you would normally use Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've chosen this size so that exercises finish quickly.  Dask.dataframe only really becomes meaningful for problems significantly larger than this, when Pandas breaks with the dreaded \n",
    "\n",
    "    MemoryError:  ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "Furthermore, the distributed scheduler allows the same dataframe expressions to be executed across a cluster. To enable massive \"big data\" processing, one could execute data ingestion functions such as `read_csv`, where the data is held on storage accessible to every worker node (e.g., amazon's S3), and because most operations begin by selecting only some columns, transforming and filtering the data, only relatively small amounts of data need to be communicated between the machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask.dataframe operations use `pandas` operations internally.  Generally they run at about the same speed except in the following two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dask introduces a bit of overhead, around 1ms per task.  This is usually negligible.\n",
    "2.  When Pandas releases the GIL `dask.dataframe` can call several pandas operations in parallel within a process, increasing speed somewhat proportional to the number of cores. For operations which don't release the GIL, multiple processes would be needed to get the same speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dask DataFrame Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, a Dask DataFrame feels like a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "So far, the biggest difference we've seen is that Dask operations are lazy; they build up a task graph instead of executing immediately.\n",
    "This lets Dask do operations in parallel and out of core.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dask Arrays, we saw that a `dask.array` was composed of many NumPy arrays, chunked along one or more dimensions.\n",
    "It's similar for `dask.dataframe`: a Dask DataFrame is composed of many pandas DataFrames. For `dask.dataframe` the chunking happens only along the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/_images/dask-dataframe.svg\" width=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We call each chunk a *partition*, and the upper / lower bounds are *divisions*.\n",
    "Dask *can* store information about the divisions. For now, partitions come up when you write custom functions to apply to Dask DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting `CRSDepTime` to a timestamp\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset stores timestamps as `HHMM`, which are read in as integers in `read_csv`:\n",
