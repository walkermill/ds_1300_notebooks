1,A,"The saying data is the new gold could not be more accurate in our current society. Major multinational technology companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook collect countless data on our interests, connections, shopping patterns, and interaction with websites, images, videos, etc. Take Facebook algorithms. They are designed to collect user data and determine the best content. Through advancements in computing technology, companies use algorithms to determine similarities in people's interests and share content that reflects those interests. These companies create blueprints of our identities to influence our mental patterns and generate content that will keep us on their apps/websites. More time spent on these apps results in companies collecting more data and making even more accurate algorithms. This has a significant effect on our lives as the content that we consume on a daily basis alters our perspectives. We begin to amplify our beliefs in certain ideas and fail to accept new ideas. There is also the issue of censoring on large platforms that can significantly impact the types of content we consume.

The iPhone is a great example of AI's ability to alter our way of life. When I was younger, iPhones had not yet been created, and actions that are now commonplace were done manually. People shipped letters and postcards to loved ones and friends using postal services, vacation routes were carefully mapped on physical maps, and applications such as Zoom and Skype were in the early stages of development. We spoke with family members using the landline and could only see their faces when visiting them in person. Now, I can call and text people around the globe by simply opening Whatsapp and requesting a video call. Everything is automated and easy. 
Amazon is another good example of the power of algorithms. My buying patterns are tracked, and new items are recommended on my account and other websites to encourage further purchasing."
2,A,"The presence of data, artificial intelligence, and computing is constantly becoming more apparent in our lives. From the moment we wake up, we rely on the information provided to inform us how to go about our day. Data collected on the weather ranges in severity, from how to schedule our daily activities to when to take shelter when necessary. Likewise, all the news we receive, both locally and globally, is collected, compiled, and organized in levels of importance. The styles we wear, the products we buy, and even the opinions we make on what is ""trendy"" vs. what is ""outdated"" result from the intersection of these tools. Although some types of artificial intelligence and the use of data are prevalent, such as tailored advertisements, facial recognition in smartphones, or self-driving cars, there are other more subtle uses of these technologies. One I had not considered before this class was how mapping apps use our location to let other users know the level of traffic on a given route. As humans, we act as computers crunching and assessing each piece of information we have and releasing certain pieces of data we deem necessary. One could look at the algorithms in our lives as the standards we have created or been taught, which we thus compare new information, such as facts, scenarios, social cues, questionable situations, etc to. We compare the data with our programmed beliefs to decide how to act. Just as algorithms consist of a specific list of rules, we create routines for ourselves, working in loops of consistent reactions to each new piece of data. That being said, we must consider that algorithms are constantly evolving, and likewise, the way we process information and react to it may be altered as well. For example, if one taught themselves to cope with emotions by eating sweets, that person would consistently run that function until their process is reprogrammed to cope with emotions by exercising. "
3,A,"In our current world, the use of data is both the most interesting and the most manipulated part of obtaining information. We can twist and adjust data to align with our interests, presenting a narrative that we choose. Data, artificial intelligence (AI), and computing are all intertwined, impacting our everyday lives in ways we often take for granted.
As a human, I am a constant source of data. But beyond the physical world, with digital interaction from social media to online shopping preferences, the technology I use contributes to a vast pool of information about me. This personal data, when processed and analyzed, provides insights into my behavior, preferences, and routines. For instance, my smartphone tracks my location and learns about the places I frequently visit. It might recommend a new restaurant nearby, based on my past dining preferences and search history. Similarly, music streaming services like Spotify use algorithms to understand my musical tastes and suggest new songs or artists I might enjoy.
Artificial intelligence algorithms alter the way I do things by helping me make decisions, often without me even realizing it. The advertisements I see online are not random; they are targeted based on my browsing history, demographic information, and interests. Search engines like Google use complex algorithms to present the most relevant information based on my search queries. Even my email service uses AI to filter spam messages, ensuring that only relevant emails reach my inbox.
The intersection of data, AI, and computing also affects the way I consume news and information. Social media platforms use algorithms to curate content based on my interactions, essentially shaping my online experience and worldview. The recommendations on my Netflix account are determined by an AI that analyzes my viewing history and ratings.
In conclusion, data, AI, and computing are integral parts of my everyday life. They shape my experiences, influence my decisions, and streamline my interactions in the digital world. While this convergence brings numerous conveniences, it also highlights the importance of responsible data management and algorithmic transparency. As humanity continues to navigate this data-driven era, we must strive to use these powerful tools ethically and thoughtfully."
4,A,"In my everyday life I do not really take notice to the intersection of data, AI, and computing because it is something I have always grown up around. I did not really know what each meant and how it effected me until I took a step back and realized how prevalent it was in my life. I am constantly on my phone using Tik Tok and Instagram so data is constantly being collected about me. I even started to notice that my frequently used apps would be recommend to me on my phones search bar. I feel like the algorithm’s greatly effect what I am seeing on social media. When I online shop on my computer I always find items in my cart end up as targeted ads on my phone usually appearing through Instagram. I feel like I have the least amount of experience with AI. Earlier this month snapchat AI was put on my phone without me even realizing it and I have yet to interact with it. The snapchat AI has almost been taken advantage of as a joke. When I scroll through my Tik Tok feed I see people typing outlandish thing into snapchat AI just to see their reaction and laugh at it. When it comes to computing I first interrupted it as math and calculators. I did not realize that computing was more like following a set of rules than it was completing a mathematical problem. I thought the example used in class about the self driving cars was really helpful in further understand the definition of computing. An example where I see computing most would be in my daily routine. I love to make a unique plan for the day and tend to make myself and the others around my stick to it. "
5,A,"The advancement of the human race has been linked to the remarkable progress in the intersection of data, artificial intelligence, and computing, significantly impacting our everyday lives. We have become active sources of data through our digital interactions, from social media posts and online shopping preferences to health and fitness tracking. The sheer volume of this data provides valuable insights that drive decision-making processes and shape various aspects of our lives. For instance, personalized advertisements tailored to our interests are a result of algorithms analyzing our online behavior and preferences. These algorithms, powered by artificial intelligence, alter the way we make purchasing decisions and influence our consumer experiences.

Moreover, data-driven technologies have revolutionized fields like healthcare. With the integration of AI and computing, medical professionals can now leverage vast amounts of patient data to enhance diagnoses and treatment plans. AI algorithms can analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, more accurately and efficiently than human experts, leading to improved disease detection rates and faster diagnoses. Additionally, wearable devices and health apps collect real-time data on our vitals and physical activities, empowering individuals to proactively monitor their well-being and make informed lifestyle choices.

The fusion of data, AI, and computing has also transformed transportation systems. Ride-sharing platforms utilize algorithms to match drivers with passengers, optimizing route planning and reducing wait times. Navigation apps employ real-time traffic data to suggest alternative routes, helping us navigate congested areas swiftly. Furthermore, the emergence of autonomous vehicles relies heavily on data processing and AI capabilities. These vehicles utilize sensors and cameras to gather information about the environment, enabling them to make split-second decisions for safe and efficient travel.

In the realm of entertainment, streaming platforms employ recommendation systems to curate personalized content based on our viewing history and preferences. These algorithms analyze vast datasets to suggest movies, TV shows, or music tailored to our tastes, making it easier to discover new content that aligns with our interests. Additionally, AI-powered voice assistants have become indispensable companions, helping us manage tasks, provide information, and control smart devices through natural language interactions.

In conclusion, the convergence of data, artificial intelligence, and computing has become deeply embedded in our everyday lives. We generate data as active participants in the digital world, while algorithms utilize this data to personalize our experiences and inform decision-making processes. From personalized advertisements and healthcare advancements to efficient transportation systems and tailored entertainment recommendations, the impact of data-driven technologies is pervasive, shaping and enhancing our daily routines in remarkable ways."
6,A,"Every day we are working with, sharing, and interacting with data, artificial intelligence, and computing. The most common interaction I experience with these three are on websites and social media. For instance, most websites I go to now ask one simple question ""click below whether you accept these cookies or not"" yet this simple question is collecting tons of data on you that will be used and sold by others. So in essence, this is how we can be a source of data. Every time you get on a website that asks this, you are essentially selling yourself, who you are, what you like, your location-- your data-- to these companies. Not only is data collection through accepting cookies on websites a large interaction I have with data but so is social media. It is common place to see specific ads and targeted information such as specific posts on social media because they are also collecting data on you and in addition have their own algorithms they have computed that essentially formulated to what they want you to see. The use of algorithms on social media specifically alters many decisions I make and perceptions I have. They intentionally push more popular context in products and influencers which I personally think has done more bad than good. Finally, I have been more effected in my day to day life by AI than ever before. Though this isn't something I use daily, it is something that is about to become a core part of all of our lives. It will most likely affect every job and has effected my thoughts about the future a lot as to how we can harness AI for something good and productive to our society without letting it take over core elements of human nature. I'm looking forward to this course as data and AI effects every day of our lives and so we should have a good understanding of this underlying element that is controlling large parts of our lives without us even knowing."
7,A,"One clear interaction of data that we see in our everyday life is through the use of social media. Everything we view on our phones through apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, is linked to the things we see around us. These apps take our data and enter it into an algorithm that then shows us things that they believe we would find interesting. This algorithm goes through your browsing history, demographic information, and buying habits to personally recommend things that spark your interest. It will also take things that someone close to you may have bought or viewed and show it to you assuming that you guys have similar interest. The longer you view an ad it makes adjustments to improve the outcome. If people view the ad for a short amount of time or exit out of it too fast then the algorithm may adjust the target audience to improve the performance. This has however, sparked concern with how much information is being used for advertisements with consumers privacy. 

Another interaction with AI algorithms is through traffic predictions. When using apps like Google Maps and Waze to get to a location, they use data to predict real-time traffic and will recommend different routes. In doing this, it takes the average amount of time it should take for you to drive to a certain place, then sees how long it is taking someone else and how many people seem to be on that rode. This is how it gets estimates on your ETA as it analyzes data on traffic and weather. AI is also able to analyze data on accident history and areas that have a higher probability of accidents. This can alert drivers about potential hazards that can cause accidents or direct them a different way if there is an accident. "
8,A,"The intersection of data, artificial intelligence and computing has an increasingly large effect on my daily life through the technology I use. Everyday there numerous devices I use that gather data about me, my daily habits/actions and interests. My fitness watch even collects data while I sleep. It uses that data to compile reports about my sleep and gives me tips on how I can improve such. Complex programs like these as well as artificial intelligence are capable of analyzing massive amounts of data collect from not only ourselves but the people around us, and provide ways to improve our efficiency. Google Maps is a program I use on a daily basis to ensure I am always taking the most efficient routes when driving anywhere over a couple miles away. Even though I am capable of driving home without looking up directions, utilizing a computing program like Google Maps allows me to save time and gas by using data to find the quickest way home while avoiding traffic. Another popular way humans create data on a daily basis is through their browser history which is collected, analyzed and sold to companies to target ads. This changes the way many people find products online and ultimately influences which products they buy and use. Overall, all of these intersections between data, artificial intelligence and complex algorithms provide ways for humans to optimize their lives and technology use. As technology becomes a larger and larger part of our lives it’s important that we embrace these intersections. While it is reasonable to have some concerns about privacy, the main purpose of these interactions and data collection is to optimize the economy, technology we use and our daily lives. "
9,A,"By living, we create data points. This pre-existed the idea of data (in my opinion) because humans innately work to assign meaning to data gathered from sensory receptors. Before computerization, the task of quantifying life was impossible, handled by the Immanuel Kants and Aristotles of the world as they tried to formulaically 'determine' the nature of life. Now, the data we leave with our actions, choices, and even thoughts (I firmly view the phone/digital ecosystem as an extension of the mind) can be compiled and quantified into algorithms to determine buying, listening, reading, driving (etc. truly) habits. The phrase ""people are not numbers"" has never felt so contestable, especially given instances where algorithms can successfully detect a medical condition or pregnancy based solely on the actions (data points) of the subject. Thus, the data 'world' really is an interesting ecosystem where by even living you are being influenced by the yields of data while contributing to a broader algorithm's ability to accurately understand human behavior. To avoid going into a philosophy rabbit hole about epistemic asymptotes and what AI shows us about the nature of humanity, I started thinking about how this looks specifically in my music listening.

Spotify knows a lot about me from their own data and how that information extends to other data in an interconnected web. When I created an account, I imagine they already had a pretty good idea of the kinds of things I would listen to solely from historical data attached to my hardware and digital activity. While these algorithms are predictive, they obviously cannot predict exactly what I want to listen to, so they do what I do to get better at working with data: observe. The more I make decisions that can be data-ified, the more Spotify knows about my listening habits: they know what kinds of songs I listen to when driving, what kind of songs I skip while driving, which artists I listen to when I'm sad, what my friends are listening to, the list truly goes on. My data can then be contextualized with the data of every single other user with varying degrees of similarities to form profiles of people and their behavior in a way that can be understood by a machine founded upon 1s and 0s. The algorithm is constantly getting more personalized while using personalized data to improve the overall soundness of the algorithm. Using what it (and I should probably specify all of its data-syndicate friends) knows about me, others, and the songs, Spotify gets better and better at compiling personalized playlists, presenting me with information (new albums, new recommended playlists), and even shifting what songs 'shuffle' lands on to give me the experience their algorithm assumes I want. I bet if I were to look up an ex's Instagram, scroll for a second, and then open Spotify, that would be enough for Spotify to be really pushy about listening to some Frank Ocean (because that's what sad people do)."
10,A,"For me, the intersection between data, AI, and computing affects me through the constant use of social media. For example, the Instagram algorithm checks for what I interact with, whether I share/ like/ or comment, or even how long I look at something. Instagram stores it away and applies my data to other posts. If I like a lot of content, Instagram will continue to feed me similar content to keep me engaged. I don't think that I would alter much of how I act on social media, though I do know that if I interact with a lot of posts that give false information, that I will continue to get that content. Similarly, on youtube, everytime you sign in and get youtube recommendations, it is normally based off of videos that you have watched before. Youtube  also compares me to  people who watched similar videos and then recommends videos that they have watched as well. I can only assume that my data is being used in similar ways. As stated earlier, I do not think I would alter how I do things. I know that companies track my phone to send targeted ads associated with the places that I frequent, or even just to update traffic or wait times at restaurants. It would be very hard to change my life enough to not be affected by AI or data collection, as a lot of what I use is dependent on it. I rely heavily on GPS apps to get places as quickly as possible, and I would need to be tracked one way or another to do so. I am not overly concerned with my data being used, and that may be due to growing up with it, but in this day and age, data collection exsists in so many different forms that I will always be data in some form or another."
11,A,"I just completed my first semester at SMU after transferring in last Fall. My initial desire was largely based around becoming a Software Engineer and studying Computer Science. However, as I began to dig further into the program in Lyle, the more I realized that this world is not something I have a strong desire to immerse myself in. However, along the way I discovered my aptitude of design and visualization were my true strengths.

The intersection of data, artificial intelligence and computing are widely affecting our daily lives. They impact almost every decision we make across the board and therefore the study of data is vital to the future of humanity. While the continued progression of artificial intelligence slides past our understanding as humans, we must put a strong emphasis on the ethics of what we are so willingly pouring our thoughts and emotions into.

Regardless of our opinion of how data should be stored and/or used for our ""benefit"" it shouldn't go unnoticed. Just simply by opening our phones and doing a mundane task of checking our email, we have given data points for companies to store. A more specific example may include taking a weekend trip to Austin and booking an AirBnb or hotel. These decisions are made and that data is immediately stored to continue building a profile of us for AirBnb/hotel (for the booking), Google (maps and search), Airlines (if ticket is needed for travel), Booking Site (if needed), Social Media (the first post made in a different city), and etc. Every little move we make as individuals is tracked and used for our benefit. The algorithms take all of this new data about our trip to Austin and begin to curate ads that seemingly fit our preferences based on recent activity.

This is simply how society currently operates and is seemingly unavoidable. As the never ending innovation of processing chips continues we will need to be more aware of these things. Not because of cynical behavior from other big companies and their human desires but more so with the thought of AI. We simply do not know how to control such an incredible piece of technology that has been trained to learn from every individual user. This data set will be larger than any other on record and giving AI that type of inherit power will eventually pose problems to humanity as a whole. The ethics must be quickly strangled in order to avoid losing control of a system with no bounds like AI."
12,A,"Data, the collection of information; artificial intelligence, the auto-generating programming; computing, the daily tasks done by a computer, intersect in our personal and professional spaces. In our everyday life, computing is done when we access information on our personal devices, which often involves searching and accessing a vast amount of data. For example, searching on Google gives access to quadrillions of internet links to the user, which the computing searches the data to present answers to any user query. Or in Google Maps, the mapping of a route takes algorithms that calculate the most optimal route in terms of time, and the computing in the algorithm analyzes the complicated database of maps to form the best routes for the user. Since Google has access to the number of users in a certain area, the company's algorithm, while mapping the best route to the destination to the users, directs their users to the roads with the least amount of traffic possible. Yet when all the queries are guided to that un-busy street, the street can get busy due to the Google algorithm. Then the algorithm will give the new queries another least-busy route that most customers would not otherwise expect. In this way, in computing and processing the vast amount of data, the algorithm silently directs traffic to fit the request of all customer queries, controlling the city traffic with secret hands.  With the help of Artificial Intelligence, however, access to the result of these computing tasks can be swift. With the help of natural language processing, GPT programs use AI to code custom programs tailored to the users' requests, making the random and personal computation requests faster than ever. AI and similar self-programming algorithms give great convenience to our everyday lives, such as it can help me write the conclusion to this homework: ""In conclusion, the intersection of data, artificial intelligence, and computing has become an integral part of our everyday lives, affecting everything from the way we search for information to how we navigate the world around us. The vast amounts of data that are collected and analyzed by algorithms are shaping the way we interact with technology, making our daily tasks more convenient and efficient. However, as with any technology, there are also potential downsides to consider, such as the unintended consequences of algorithms and the potential for data misuse. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of these risks and to take steps to ensure the responsible use of technology in our daily lives."" (chat.openai.com)"
13,A,"Data is everywhere. Even if we don't notice it. Our phones though are the most prevalent places we see data. The average American sees around 4000 to 10000 ads every single day, and it would not be far fetched to say that every single one of those ads uses data to target a specific audience. How do people target ads though? Through the use of data. Companies use data about their customers to target their ads towards them. That includes myself and everyone else who has ever bought anything. A company can use data on things like how old the average customer of their product is to discern what age group they should be targeting. With that knowledge, they can create ads that appear on tv channels watched by their target age demographic. Apps like TikTok get even more clever though. They use their gigantic user base to gather data on millions and millions of people. They can either sell that data to outside sources, or they can sell you. They do this by using their mass amounts of data to build a profile of each user and what they want to see or buy. By doing so, they can keep users on the app longer. This means that the user will see more ads, and those ad spaces have been bought by companies because TikTok can use their data to show the ads to people who are most likely to buy the company's product. That process happens all day every day and we never really notice it, and that is how data is used in ads. Large datasets can help train AIs. Most relevantly we can look at ChatGPT for that. ChatGPT uses huge datasets to train itself on how to accurately reply, talk, and more. That is how it has become so accurate. The way data alters how I do things is probably more than I even know, but just on the surface I am willing to take weird roads I've never seen before just because Google's algorithm told me so. I also spend way more time than I should watching TikTok because it is so good at keeping me entertained through their algorithm."
14,A,"In today’s day and age, data is one of the most powerful tools in existence. Every aspect of our lives is a potential data point. Everything from what we do on our phones to what kind of food we buy at the grocery store is a piece of data that companies are willing to pay a fortune to acquire. Companies like Amazon collect data on what each user looks at, searches for, and buys. They use this data to advertise future products to the users that they might be interested in purchasing. Leveraging user data for advertising is a tremendous business opportunity for large companies. Google made a staggering $279.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 from advertising alone. Artificial intelligence and machine learning is another way data is having a tremendous effect on our lives. Artificial intelligence is able to learn from the data that is collected from users, and then use this newfound knowledge to impact the world. Large language models are able to learn from questions posed by users and then provide fairly accurate responses. While artificial intelligence isn’t perfect, its drastic improvement in recent years shows its great potential. A survey from Ipsos in 2021 found that many of the adults surveyed thought that artificial intelligence would impact fields like education, shopping, employment, entertainment, and whole lot more. Even algorithms that aren’t as complex as machine learning programs affect our lives. Every new car nowadays comes with numerous algorithms that improve the driving experience by making it easier and more comfortable. Parking sense, lane change assist, and adaptive cruise control are all examples of ways computing impacts our lives. In a world in which data is everywhere, it is important to be able to identify connections between different data sets to discover useful insights and make critical decisions."
15,A,"I use computers and algorithms everyday of my life. I mainly use technology in my daily life to communicate with people and locate different places. Technology makes my life easier because it allows me to predict my activities for the day and manage time. My iPhone, however, also serves as a distraction because of the apps that I have downloaded and the algorithms they utilize to keep my attention. Youtube, for example, is a great tool for educating myself on various skills that I want to learn such as cooking. However, I do spend a lot of time on YouTube watching videos about WW2 and clips of breaking bad. These apps use my data to increase the amount of time I spend on them which is not something that I plan when I am going through the day. The negative aspect of modern social media, computers, and algorithms is that we can use them anytime of the day we would like, practically anywhere. I am probably a big source of data collecting because I take my phone with me everywhere I go. Apps that track my location like google maps, snapchat, and uber eats know where I live and work because I use their services. I feel like this is the most harmful aspect of data collecting because it can be used in harmful ways. My location could be leaked to a third party which can lead to targeted ads and unwanted restrictions on my access to technology. "
16,A,"Data, artificial intelligence, and computing affect my everyday life. On campus alone, my computer is required for classes, AI is becoming a part of multiple Syllabuses for classes I’m in, and data is stored in my SMU ID. It scans me into the buildings I’m allowed into, into my room, pays for the food I eat on campus and even helps me get my mail. Meanwhile, every ad I see is the result of some algorithms and an amalgamation of data that I have put into my devices. My feed on all social media is a compilation of that as well. I use Uber and or a maps app to get anywhere I am not familiar with, and that too is all transactions of data and algorithms. Really any time I pay for something with a card or apple pay. 

I really liked the analogy used today, “garbage in means garbage out.” People need to be accountable for the data they're putting into the world because that is what they’re getting out of it. We need to be aware that unless we search for data outside of ourselves we will only ever be exposed to variations of what we already know. At least, through our devices. That is both wonderful and dangerous. I was once told that the internet is like a chainsaw, a star in horror as well as just a tool. The important thing is that we attribute the bias and nature of the tool to the person who wields it; not to the tool itself. Certain rules and safety precautions must be acknowledged before use, it cannot be left with your children to play with unless they understand its use and abilities, etc. So yes, we have been told to fear it our whole lives but in truth, technology can only do what it's told. It is a middleman or tool in a person’s agenda. I can’t speak for the future, but I can say that any turn of events in technology would still be attributed to human invention. Not from a natural evolution of the technology itself. "
17,A,"The use of data is everywhere as soon as you open up the internet. From education to social media to navigation, data is collected on where you want to go, what you are doing, and when you are doing it. When I think of data in our every day life, I think of social media which is really dangerous as we spend so much time and expose so much of our lives to it such as our preferences, our opinions, and our personal lives. We can also be a source of data by what we look up on the internet such as if we are interested in buying something, going on a trip, or researching something. This all allows us to give data to be collected. It usually escapes my mind or concern when I am on the internet but we are always being tracked and always giving information to some machine that is just making a profile. This allows us to be targeted in advertising and the posts that we see on social media. The intersection of data science and artificial intelligence I think should be approached with caution. There is a lot of good that can come out of data collection and tracking such as environmental solutions and human safety but there is also a lot that can be dangerous such as artificial intelligence learning so much about our lives. The fact that massive amounts of data can be sold for very little is dangerous in itself as anyone can obtain this information and use it in an unethical manner. "
18,A,"Before this class data science meant nothing to me. I didn't really know much about it or have any clue what it was but I figured maybe it had something to do with analyzing statistics. I am sure in this class I will gain a better understanding and learn what it really means and how it is applied to everyday life. I think right now that the intersection of data, artificial intelligence and computing effect everybody's lives without them knowing. Whenever we use our phones or computers we do not realize it but technology is listening to us and keeping track of what we say and what we find interest in. We see this on social media when we get ads and are confused how they correlate with the conversations we were just having with other people. It seems like people are starting to become aware of this though because on tiktok there will be videos of people purposefully talking into their spouses phone or friends phone so that specific things come up. Also on tiktok we see that our searched up videos or liked videos create this algorithm for ourselves and put us on certain ""sides"" of tiktok because of that. There is even an active AI on snapchat now that can answer any question you have at any moment and knows your location. These AI's are becoming more and more relevant in our lives and are starting to become well known. Another AI type of thing that we see a lot today is chat gpt where it can do basically any command for you by just typing in your request. We even learned in class today that there is a super computer that owns all of our data from the last 6 years. It is truly crazy how we have our lives be totally invaded and have no idea. "
19,A,"The intersection of data, artificial intelligence, and computing affects my everyday life, even if I may not be aware of it. This affects me whether I am on social media, using a navigation app, or doing online shopping, and I am constantly generating data that can be used for algorithms. My data is collected when I search for products online, and my data about my search history and preferences are then analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms. The results are based on this data and used to personalize my profile as I receive suggestions on similar products that I might be interested in. Similarly, my social media newsfeed is personalized by algorithms, showing me content that is most relevant to my interests. 

For example, when I use Google Maps to route to my destination, I rely on the navigation system to predict traffic and the best route to reach my destination in the least amount of time. Such apps rely heavily on constantly collecting data to adjust their prediction based on the number of phones on the road and their speed. In addition, after I make a purchase online from a specific website, the recommendations that I see pop up on my browser are from that same website. This is because of recommendation algorithms. Through analyzing my purchase history and the websites I frequent the most, these algorithms suggest products and websites that appeal to me. 
"
20,A,"The intersection of data, artificial intelligence, and computing has become an integral part of my life, especially in the past few years as a student. All data and statistics is digital now, both collected and viewed through digital means. Most of us today, myself included, are daily users of social media. Our feeds display the type of content we want by seeing our past data of posts we have liked and saved in order to display to us an adequate feed of content we wish to see that we continue to like that reinforces this data. AI or artificial intelligence is a term that has been familiar to me for years, but it is a term I hear almost daily this year now, as opposed to previous years when I only thought of the terminator when someone mentioned artificial intelligence. It should come as no surprise as a college student AI has become something I rely on, admittedly I used chatgpt for some assistance on this assignment, as I just came home from a movie at 1 am, and was having difficulty writing about this topic I am unfamiliar with. But I still use artificial intelligence outside chatgpt, I had to use Siri to map me to the movie theatre from my friends concert. Siri had to compute the map of my city to show me the best route to get to the theatre, including seeing which way had the least amount of traffic. In terms of computing, I could not type any of this without a functional laptop. My laptop would be worth as much as a brick if it could not compute and function in various ways.
